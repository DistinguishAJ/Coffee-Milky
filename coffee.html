            <h3>About Us <span>Our Story</span></h3>
            <p>Coffee Milky began with a simple craving: to make barista-quality, creamy coffee as easy to get as your morning paper. 
                <br>What started as a weekend pop-up has grown into a team of passionate coffee lovers who care about every step of the cup — from selecting responsibly roasted beans to perfecting the milk texture that gives our drinks their signature velvet mouthfeel. 
                <br>We believe great coffee should be both approachable and exceptional, so we focus on balanced recipes that highlight origin flavors while keeping that comforting, milky finish customers love. 
                <br>We work closely with small roasters and farmers to source beans that are flavorful and ethically produced, and our baristas train to bring consistency and care to every order. 
                <br>Whether it’s a classic latte, a creamy cold brew, or one of our seasonal specialties, each drink is crafted to deliver a smooth, satisfying experience. 
                <br>Fast, reliable delivery is part of our promise your favorite cup arrives fresh and ready to enjoy, with minimal fuss.
                <br>More than coffee, Coffee Milky is about making mornings cozier and routines a little kinder. 
                <br>We’re committed to sustainable practices where we can, friendly service every day, and building a community of coffee lovers who appreciate warmth in every sip. 
                <br>Join us and let Coffee Milky be the gentle lift to your day  one perfect, milky cup at a time. 
                <br>Join us and make every morning a little cozier one perfect cup at a time.</p>
